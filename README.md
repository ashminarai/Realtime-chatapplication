**ðŸš€ Embark on an Epic Real-Time Chat Experience! ðŸš€**

A first-of-its-kind real-time chat application built with NodeJS and SocketIo (more like a group chat). The GUI is minimal and is only intended as a practice to learn how to utilize socketIo to hold a chat between two individuals.

**1. Requirement**

- NodeJS
- SocketIo

**2. Folder style**

project_folder
  - index.html
  - js
     - client.js
  - CSS
     - Style.css
  - Images
     - chat.png
  - Server
     - index.js

**3. Run the server using nodemon index.js**

**4. Run the index.html in your browser.**
